# TSClientInfo
get terminal service information about rdp and citrix (list sessions)
This project created for monitor sessions (citrix,rdp and others) in windows. 
I test it in windows 2003(legacy code - citrix meteframe xp ) , and windows serve 2008 and windows 7 , the output is :
SessionID 
UserName
ClientIP 
ClientName

The application is useful when what to find client IP address in remote session.
